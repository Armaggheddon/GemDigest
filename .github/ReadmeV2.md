<h2 id="itroduction">📔  Itroduction</h2>
<h3 align="center">Introducing GemDigest: Your Personal Article Summarizer for Telegram! 📜✨</h3>
<p>
    Are you tired of wading through endless articles filled with redundant information, unclear points, or annoying ads? GemDigest is here to help! This simple yet powerful Telegram bot lets you quickly summarize articles from various websites, giving you a clear and concise summary in just a few sentences.
</p>
<p>
    Whether you’re chatting one-on-one or in a group, GemDigest works seamlessly in the background. We all have that friend who loves to share links to articles and websites, but let’s face it—sometimes there’s just not enough time to read them all. With GemDigest, simply paste the link into the chat, and the bot will automatically generate a summary for you, saving you time and energy. No extra commands to memorize, no complicated steps involved—just share the link, and let the magic happen! 🧙‍♂️✨ The bot will recognize the links and reply with a summary, while ignoring any non-link messages to keep your conversations flowing smoothly. 💬🔗

<br/>
<h3 align="center">Customize Your Experience 🎯</h3>
<p>
    As an added feature, you can even specify which people you want the bot to focus on. This way, GemDigest will summarize only the links sent by specific users and ignore others—perfect for group chats where only certain recommendations matter to you! 👥📲

<br/>
<h3 align="center">Powered by Google Gemini 🚀</h3>
<p>
    GemDigest uses the power of Google’s Gemini API, so you don’t need any specialized or high-performance hardware to enjoy this feature. All the heavy lifting is done by Google’s servers, meaning the bot is fast, reliable, and doesn’t require any expensive infrastructure on your end. 💡 The best part? The Google Gemini API is completely free (with some limitations), so you won’t have to spend a cent! 💰
</p>
<p>
    With GemDigest, say goodbye to lengthy articles and hello to quick, easy-to-read summaries! Save time, stay informed, and focus on what really matters.
