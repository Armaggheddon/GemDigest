    "summary": "🍇 LeafSense is a revolutionary app that uses AI to 
    help vineyard owners identify diseases early on. Simply take a 
    picture of a leaf with your smartphone, and LeafSense's algorithms 
    will analyze it for signs of disease. The app provides a 'probability index' 
    to let you know how likely a problem is. 💪 If you need more information,
    you can access a built-in encyclopedia of vineyard diseases or even export
    the image to your technician for further analysis. 🔍 The app also allows
    you to save results and locations to keep track of potential issues in 
    your vineyard. 🗺️ LeafSense empowers farmers by offering real-time disease
    monitoring and helping them make informed decisions to protect their 
    crops. 🌱",
